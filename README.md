# 3d-Website


This GitHub project is dedicated to creating a visually stunning one-page website with 3D image animation and text animation, enhanced with smooth scrolling for an engaging user experience. We use cutting-edge technologies and libraries, including "gaps" for animating elements, "Locomotive Scroll" (powered by Locomotive.js) for seamless and precise scrolling, and "shery.js" by [asynchronousJavascriptor](https://github.com/asynchronousJavascriptor) for dynamic image animation.

## Key Features

1. **3D Image Animation:** We leverage modern web technologies to create captivating 3D animations that bring your website to life. These animations can be applied to images and other elements, making your content truly immersive, with the help of "shery.js."

2. **Text Animation:** Elevate your website's content with eye-catching text animations. Whether it's fading in, sliding in, or any other dynamic effect, we've got you covered to ensure your message stands out.

3. **Smooth Scrolling:** We employ Locomotive Scroll, a JavaScript library that provides buttery-smooth and precise scrolling. Users can navigate your one-page website effortlessly, enhancing the overall user experience.

## Technologies and Tools

- **HTML/CSS:** We use standard web technologies for structuring and styling the content.
- **JavaScript:** For adding interactivity, animation, and integrating Locomotive Scroll and "shery.js" for dynamic image animation.
- **Gaps:** A library for creating beautiful and seamless animations.
- **Locomotive Scroll:** A lightweight and performant smooth scrolling library for enhanced user navigation.
- **shery.js:** A powerful library by [asynchronousJavascriptor](https://github.com/asynchronousJavascriptor) for creating dynamic image animations.
